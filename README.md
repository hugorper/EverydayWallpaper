```

    en-NZ, en-CA.

## Result (sample output)
````json
{
  "images": [
    {
      "startdate": "20151130",
      "fullstartdate": "201511300800",
      "enddate": "20151201",
      "url": "/az/hprichbg/rb/Modica_EN-US11378362609_1920x1080.jpg",
      "urlbase": "/az/hprichbg/rb/Modica_EN-US11378362609",
      "copyright": "Modica, Sicily, Italy (Â© Robert Harding World Imagery/Offset)",
      "copyrightlink": "http://www.bing.com/search?q=Modica,+Sicily,+Italy&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate:%2220151130_0800%22",
...
````

The values used by the apps are 'startdate', 'enddate' and 'urlbase'. Unlike 'url' the 'url base' contain a part of the full image path, to have to full one I must concat the resolution of the image.

### Resolution
List of supported resolutions:

````js
"176x220", "220x176", "240x240", "240x320", "240x400", "320x240", "320x320", "360x480", "400x240", "480x360", "480x640", "480x800", "640x480", "768x1024", "800x480", "800x600", "1024x768", "1280x720", "1280x768", "1366x768", "1920x1080", "1920x1200"

## Schedule Background Wallpaper Update Task
One of the most important aspect of this application is how and when call the wallpaper update. In order to be efficient I will not use the NSTimer class, some appropriate APIs helps to perform background tasks by limiting impact on the system and increase energy efficiency.

For more information about the APIs go to [Schedule Background Activity](https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/Performance/Conceptual/power_efficiency_guidelines_osx/SchedulingBackgroundActivity.html) and with network support [Schedule Background Networking](https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/Performance/Conceptual/power_efficiency_guidelines_osx/SchedulingNetworkActivity.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40013929-CH33-SW1).

### Task scheduling
To goal is to update the wallpaper each day, the task will be scheduled each day at 05:00am.
If the computer is not connected to internet, the task must be delayed until it's connected.
This mechanisms will be managed from the WallpaperUpdateScheduler class.
